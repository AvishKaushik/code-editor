# Code Editor ***(dyte)***

Welcome to Code Editor! This is the code editor which will help to compile HTML, CSS and JavaScript and will also help us to preview the resultant website live and in action. This project was given to me by the company ***dyte*** as test for the hiring process. I hope you will enjoy seeing the things I built and created by using ReactJS.

## How does this works?

This web application is designed using ReactJS and several other libraries. This project contains Menu Bar or App Bar which will display the name of the project and the logo of the company. It also contains a hamburger button which will open a side drawer which I named as File Explorer.

File Explorer section contains three file sections i.e., index.html, index.css and index.js file. It also contains a button justified right to the heading which will close our drawer.

The main content contains the editor of the file and the live preview section as asked for. Live preview section works with a bit of the delay to make the UI more appealing and comfortable to the eye. Also, these script file can also contain too much of variables which can result in the crashing of the preview section, I implemented a timeout section which will give enough time to live preview section to compile the code.
